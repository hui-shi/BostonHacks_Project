# BostonHacks_Project: Banana Ripeness Prediction

This project aims to develop a web user interface using Streamlit and Python machine/deep learning to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for extracting features from ripe and unripe banana images. The trained CNN model will be used to predict the ripeness of a banana when the user uploads an image of their banana.

## Project Overview
The project is divided into two main phases:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collect a dataset of images of ripe and unripe bananas. Preprocess the images by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting them to enhance the model's performance.

Model Training and Implementation: Train a CNN model using the preprocessed banana image data. Integrate the trained model into a Streamlit web application, enabling users to upload banana images and receive real-time ripeness predictions.
