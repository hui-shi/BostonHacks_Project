# BostonHacks_Project: Banana Ripeness Prediction

This project aims to develop a web user interface using Streamlit and Python machine/deep learning to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for extracting features from ripe and unripe banana images. The trained CNN model will be used to predict the ripeness of a banana when the user uploads an image of their banana.

## Project Overview

### Back end:
**1. Data Collection and Preprocessing**:  <br /> 
- Collect a dataset of images of ripe and unripe bananas (80% for training and 20% for validation).
- Preprocessed the images by resizing to 150x150 pixels and normalizing pixel values to [0,1].

**2. Model Training and Implementation**: <br /> 
- Evaluated model performance on the validation set in terms of loss and accuracy.
- Achieved a validation accuracy of 99.9% after 10 epochs of training.

### Front end:  <br /> 
Integrated the trained model into a Streamlit web application. Users can upload images of bananas and receive ripeness predictions.
